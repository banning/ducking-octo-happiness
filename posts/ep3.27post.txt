      <p>Today's comic comes with an astronomically incorrect sky because I didn't 
        reference anything when making it due to the previously mentioned lack 
        of Internet along with being away from my astronomy books and Starry Night 
        software. I promise future astronomy themed episodes will have more accurate 
        skies. Wait, future episodes? With most of the cast dead?</p>
      <p>I'm never mentioning when a rant is <a href="/episodes/episode.php?epsiode=3&part=26">&quot;nearly&quot; 
        finished</a> again. I planned on the newest one being up last night, then 
        I found out there isn't strong evidence for the link between electrical 
        transmission lines and childhood leukemia. So I abandoned working on it 
        and switched to drawing this strip, which has been up in the archive all 
        day, but only on the home page this evening when I finally got around 
        to finishing that rant.</p>
