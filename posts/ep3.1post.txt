      <p>This strip was ready as a three panel comic last night when I realized 
        there was so much dialogue that the word bubbles had become crowded. So 
        I made two more frames and was ready to insert the dialogue again when 
        I realized I had forgotten to change a major attribute. The word bubbles 
        are also hiding things that I realized were breaking continuity as well. 
        Everything here should be correct though.</p>
