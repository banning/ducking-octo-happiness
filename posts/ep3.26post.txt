      <p>Why is violence so funny?</p>
      <p>This comic was finished Tuesday night, but I was without Internet most 
        of the week, so it's getting uploaded Thursday afternoon. The first frame 
        did get re-edited last night though because it wasn't dark enough and 
        the turbine blades were all facing the same way, so some good came out 
        of this. The next strip won't take a week to appear. In fact, it will 
        be up tormorrow because there's only one frame left to draw. Rejoice.</p>
      <p>Also, in compensation for the lateness, clicking on the first frame of 
        this strip will produce an alternate version. Of course, that alternate 
        would have been up Tuesday night had I had Internet access.</p>
      <p>There will also be a new rant later on today once I cite my references.</p>
