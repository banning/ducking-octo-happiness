      <p>I spent a good amount of time drawing a picture of Ligeia to insert in 
        the background only to have her obscured by the tree I originally placed 
        in the shot to obscure the background so I wouldn't have to draw other 
        people in the shop. But the tree is consistent with previous <a href="episode.php?epsiode=4&part=5">shots</a> 
        at least.</p>
