            <p><font color="#000000">____</font> To return to the irrelevant news 
              posts, lets talk about String Theory and just what exactly a theory 
              is. The difference between a scientific law and a theory is that 
              laws explain how (Newton's law of gravitation describes what phenomenon 
              will be observed when two bodies containing mass interact) whereas 
              a theory explains why (Einsteinian relativity models gravity as 
              curves in space-time, thus explaining why objects move towards one 
              another). String Theory counts as a theory since it explains why 
              we observe the phenomenon that we do in the universe (modeling matter 
              and energy as one-dimensional vibrating strings). There is more, 
              however. I was taught that a scientific theory has to be falsifiable. 
              Attributing observed phenomenon to undetectable forces (such as 
              spirits, God, pranic energy, telluric currents, etc) is not theorizing 
              as such forces cannot be falsified by their nature of being undetectable. 
              (I feel people who say that magick or other preternatural forces 
              are real but beyond the detection of science are not analyzing the 
              problem enough. If you are influencing the Universe in some way, 
              it can be isolated and detected. That's a rant for another day, 
              however...) </p>
            <p><font color="#000000">____</font> General relativity is a theory. 
              Our species has observed light bending around objects in numerous 
              places in the galaxy. If light was not manipulated as Einstein had 
              calculated, his theory would have been falsified. String theory, 
              however, has never made any falsifiable claims, and since the energies 
              necessary to investiage the levels at which string theory deals 
              are currently beyond the reach of our civilization, it's not going 
              to be making any falsifiable statements in the near future. Granted 
              I hold a Bachelor's of Science and not a Doctorate, but I feel for 
              this reason the system of math labeled as &quot;String Theory&quot; 
              is not rightfully a theory. Physicist Brian Greene, String Theory's 
              ambassador to the masses, defends research into the field, saying 
              that while it cannot be falsified, when one examines the mathematics, 
              one intuitively feels that they must be right as they are so beautiful 
              and work together so well (I don't have <em>The Fabric of the Cosmos</em> 
              in front of me at the moment to get the exact quote, unfortunately). 
            </p>
            <p><font color="#000000">____</font> So entire generations of theoretical 
              physicists are pursuing a path because of aesthetics. Consider modern 
              art. The typical response to Jackson Pollock or other abstract expressionism 
              is to not consider it art at all. If one spends years studying the 
              tradition, however, one can come to see just what those artists 
              were trying to express with their blobs and thrown chunks of paint. 
              Likewise, laypeople cannot understand the advanced mathematics involved 
              in string theory, but after years of study, they can come to see 
              the beauty hidden in the esoteric equations, and revel in the dance 
              of numbers, just as one can find the beauty hidden in splatterings 
              of paint. With this in mind, I declare that string theory is not 
              a theory at all, but an unintentional art movement.</p></td>
