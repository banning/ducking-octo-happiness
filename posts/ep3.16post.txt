      <p>We've got a drawing tablet now, and although it took me a few hours to 
        get over the learning curve, the comics should take a lot less time to 
        make, which means fewer late updates. Huzzahs are in order. There will 
        also be another site redesign within the month. Everything's just changing 
        for the better around here.</p>
