<p>The character art for this one didn't take too long to do for once. It was the newspaper that caused problems, mostly for all the typos that I kept finding in it.</p>
<p>To speak briefly on one of the references made in that news article, <a href="http://redpill.dailygrail.com/wiki/Robert_Bigelow">Robert Bigelow</a> is a man in which I find much to admire. Here's someone who decided he had to help human civilization enter space, so he built a hotel empire to make enough money to eventually start building his own space stations...while also funding paranormal research under NIDS along the way.  Granted Skinwalker Ranch seems kind of a fraud (the previous owners never felt the need to photograph any of the werewolves and extradimensional portals visiting them daily?), but at least there's some serious investigation being done on border phenomenon, which is usually either dismissed without a serious look, or taken up by the lunatic fringe, which we will see as this episode develops.</p>
