      <p>When I first started putting panel three together, it didn't look how 
        I imagined it because I suck at perspective, but once I added the cysquatch, 
        I felt a lot better about it.</p>
      <p>There was originally dialogue in this strip, but I think it's stronger 
        without words. Plus the text was superfulous anyway (There's a canoe!). 
        So enjoy the silence.</p>
      <p>Dreamweaver is also showing blue as yellow in addition to red as blue, 
        so this strip looks very bizarre to me right now.</p>
