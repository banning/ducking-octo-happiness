      <p>In the spirit of simplified hands, Emily now has simplified hair.</p>
      <p>The first three episodes each run the same formula of setting up jokes 
        in the first half and then completing them in the second. <a href="episodes/I/ep1.1.html">Getting 
        the Apartment</a> might be kind of weak in that regard with the set ups 
        seeming to be <a href="episodes/I/ep1.9.html">random</a> <a href="episodes/I/ep1.14.html">nonsense</a>. 
        I think this episode handles the formula a lot better.</p>
