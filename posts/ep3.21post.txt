      <p>It's gone from a symbol of civilization to a symbol of barbarism!</p>
      <p>I've added title pages at the beginning of each episode so someone going 
        through the archive will now know when the story changes, and the <a href="bios.html">bio 
        page</a> images have been updated to not look awful.</p>
      <p>As promised, a new rant has finally been posted, about the Joker and 
        Batman and nihilism! Yay!</p>
