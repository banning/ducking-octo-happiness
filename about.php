            <td colspan="2"><p>RedBrickRoadStudios's current main project is the 
                webcomic <em>Walden</em> about a group of friends living in the 
                present Henry David Thoreau warned us against, one in which all 
                the land is owned and a man may not even walk in the woods that 
                he loves. Faced with a reality populated by the seemingly paranormal 
                that can easily be explained away by physicalist models, the cast 
                confronts the unknowable mystery of life with naivet&eacute;, 
                confusion, and arrogance.</p>
              <p>The main story is told episodically on Monday, Wednesday, and 
                Friday. Short <a href="strip_archive.php">gag strips</a> 
                are sometime posted on Sundays. They're not vital to the main 
                story arcs, however. A brief rundown of the characters can be 
                found below.</p>
              <p>Our work can also be seen on the fan section of the <a href="http://www.brokensaints.com/">Broken 
                Saints DVD</a> in the form of a stop motion Legos movie and its 
                accompanying mock-u-mentary.</p>

              maintains a generally upbeat attitude despite the pitfalls he faces 
              in his day to day journey through college life, possibly guided 
              by his belief in a logical, well-ordered Universe. He feels any 
              problem can be solved by a rational, well thought-out examination 
              followed by communicating what is learned to all parties involved. 
              And this is why all the storylines are completely conflict free...</td>

                tends to view the world rather cynically. This outlook may derive 
                from associating with other jaded artists or simply be the result 
                of watching too many 24-hour news channels. Thanks to a student 
                work program, he currently draws for the police. He can always 
                be seen with his mug of coffee or attempting to acquire a cup.</p>

                teased by Simon and Guy for learning about the outside world more 
                through Wikipedia and YouTube than actually being outside, Frank 
                isn't completely inept when it comes to pre-Information Age activities.

              conspiracy theories. He lives a free-spirited life, despite certain

              unfettered consumerism and simple mischief. May possess a tenuous
