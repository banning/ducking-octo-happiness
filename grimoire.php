              <p>In the summer of 2002, RebBrickRoadStudios created a stop motion 
                Lego movie for the <a href="http://brokensaints.com/contest/">Broken 
                Saints Big Summer Contest</a>. The work won first place in the 
                competition and was later redited for the DVD release of Broken 
                Saints with improved coloring and additional footage. Here is 
                the original version, which also went on to win second place in 
                the PA Regional Computer Fair in the &quot;Digital Movie&quot; 
                category:</p>

              <p>John later conducted an interview for a television production 
                class in which he discussed the project:</p>

              <p>The updated versions of the movie and the mockumentary that accompanies 
                it on the Broken Saints DVD were lost in a hard drive crash. However, 
                the films are still preserved on the aforementioned DVD. Once 
                we get them ripped, they will be made available here and on YouTube. 
                Or you could just buy the Broken Saints DVD.</p></td>
