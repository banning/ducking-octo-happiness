      <p>This is by far my favorite part of this episode.</p>
      <p>Did that dead body have his pants off? Come back Wednesday to find out 
        why.</p>
      <p>Originally Guy was holding the entire pack of chalk in panel four, but 
        that broke the continuity of the previous shots, so it got changed when 
        the strip was being assembled. The police car here is also an original 
        instead of a tracing like the previous. So huzzahs are in order.</p>
