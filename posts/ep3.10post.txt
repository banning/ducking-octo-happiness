      <p>With a new month comes an update to the site. The major change is that 
        the rants are now on a separate page, accessible by the link seen below. 
        This allows more space for the writings, a better appearance to the pages, 
        easier access for those who want to read the rants, and no rants for those 
        who only want to see the comic. The <a href="../../grimoire.html">Grimoire</a> 
        and <a href="../../pond.html">Walden Pond</a> interface have been updated 
        as well, along with alt tags that had been previously forgotten. So enjoy 
        as we continue to improve things around here. (Also, if you find any broken 
        links or other erros, please notify us.)</p>
