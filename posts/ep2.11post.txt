      <p>The Mailman is one of the oldest character designs in the comic. He exists 
        mostly so his head can explode ala <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088846/">Brazil</a>. 
        While the design has existed for years, the dialogue didn't get written 
        until I was putting the strip together Monday night. I thought about leaving 
        this scene out since there weren't any words written, just knowledge that 
        the Core says &quot;something&quot; to make him angry, and since this 
        adds nothing to the episode other than to show Guy acquiring coffee, which 
        will become very important shortly. Now this has ended up being my favorite 
        part thus far.</p>
