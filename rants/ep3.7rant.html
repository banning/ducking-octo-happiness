              a revolver and the phrase &quot;The Simplest Surreal Act.&quot; 
              In the first Surrealist Manifesot, Andr&eacute; Breton states &quot;The 
              simplest Surrealist act consists of dashing down into the street, 
              pistol in hand, and firing blindly, as fast as you can pull the 
              trigger, into the crowd.&quot; So I guess the French are to blame 
              for all the school shootings and not Marilyn Manson, although he 
              is a self-identified surrealist. I was going to link an article 
              calling 9-11 the ultimate surreal act since I've already called 
              string theory and the Great Pacific Garbage Patch art, but I'm unfortunately 
              unable to locate it. The author summarizes the denouncement of the 
              West and calls for its destruction by surrealist figureheads and 
              their championing of irrationality and Oriental values. He also 
              references the recurring theme of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Tomorrow_is_Never.jpg">skyscrapers</a> 
              and <a href="http://wahooart.com/A55A04/w.nsf/Opra/BRUE-5ZKF3C">plains</a> 
              seen in many paintings of the era. In citing this, I'm not saying 
              the attacks on that day are a result of the surrealist movement, 
              but that both are products of a twentieth century western civilization 
              and its emphasis on the accumulation of capital. But whereas the 
              surrealists only spoke of destruction in their rebellion against 
              the norms of society, contemporary Muslim unrest with corporate 
              expansion at the expense of human rights has flourished into violence, 
              and leaders in the West have exploited this rage to consolidate 
              their power over the masses. </p>
            <p> <font color="#000000">____</font> One of the functions of art 
              is to act as a catharsis and to help us comprehend our existence. 
              Surrealism could only have been engendered out of the twentieth 
              century milieu. The perceived failures of rationality in the face 
              of world war and an oppressed working class spawned the denouncement 
              of the values of the culture that produced such horrors. Violence 
              is a reaction to one's surroundings whereas art is a reflection 
              on them. The uniform description of 9-11 as &quot;surreal&quot; 
              is indeed appropriate in light of the manifestoes of the 1920's 
              as it was the literal response to the anxieties the surrealists 
              were attempting to describe philosophically. And with the philosophy 
              already in place, people turned to its ideas, now imbedded in our 
              culture, to attempt to understand the horror they were witnessing. 
              9-11 could be considered the ultimate surreal act merely because 
              that philosophy can describe that day and the events surrounding 
              it so well and perhaps even calls for such attacks, but only because 
              such thought has been engendered by the same cultural forces which 
              precipitated the destruction of 9-11. The values of our civilization 
              are the over-arching forces at play here, and the cataclysms they 
              produce and the philosophies used to describe them are a sign of 
              how sick things have become.</p></td>
