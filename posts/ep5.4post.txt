<p>Hey, a Friday strip finished before Friday afternoon for once.  I'd like to thank Whitley Strieber for this accomplishment and the sigils detailed in the CARET documents.  And the drones that follow me home from work everyday.</p>
<p>Like most people, the local news is confusing unidentified flying objects with space travelers with crop art.  "Unidentified aerial phenomenon" has emerged as a meme to get around the seemingly unbreakable link between aliens and things in the sky that can't quite be made out, and "phenomenon" handles distortions of light that aren't exactly objects, but I haven't heard UAP mentioned outside of blogs.  Most people don't seem to have an appreciation for the language they use to communicate ideas, so decades of media hype probably aren't going to be overcome and the idea of aliens will continue to be leapt to by scoffers when agnosticism would be the most logical approach.</p>
