      <p>If things were on schedule, today would be the first part of Episode 
        III. Instead, I've been travelling a lot lately and preparing to relocate, 
        so the comic is a bit behind, but still being worked on, as today's update 
        clearly illustrates. The dialogue here was written over a year ago. I 
        blame the coincidence on the self-transforming- machine-elves who control 
        the Universe.</p>
