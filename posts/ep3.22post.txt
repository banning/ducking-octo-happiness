      <p>Happy arbitrary new year in the Gregorian calendrical system! The first 
        frame of this strip is so beautiful. Then the grill that can be seen in 
        the second is invisible in the fourth. Oh well. The Ministry of Truth 
        will eventually correct that just like it recently corrected several older 
        comics without comment.</p>
