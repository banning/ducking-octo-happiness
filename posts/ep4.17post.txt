12 Mar 2008</p>      <p>Here are my freakish attempts at German shepherds.</p>      <p><a href="http://www.space.gc.ca/asc/eng/iss/mss_spdm.asp">Dextre</a> is being assembled in orbit this week. This is probably one of the coolest aspects of the boondoggle that is the ISS. Although the laboratories are finally being attached and construction should be complete in two years, so hopefully some use should come of the station and NASA can start focusing on further destinations... unless Obama wins the presidency, then everything's getting <a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/11/obama-pits-huma.html">thrown away</a>. At least we'll still have <a href="http://www.scaled.com/">Burt Rutan</a> and <a href="http://www.bigelowaerospace.com/">Robert Bigelow</a> to expand our civiiization out of the cradle (but hopefully not endlessly orbiting).
