<p>19 Mar 2008</p><p>Wow, episode IV is over already. That can be attributed to every update         being made on time for once (Well there was that Friday strip that went         up on a Saturday, but it didn't affect the timing of any of the other         parts).</p>      <p>I had the hardest time figuring out Guy's painting for this part. Hopefully         it works well enough. Also, the last time we saw Guy and Emily dressed         like that, they <a href="episodes/I/ep1.21.html">looked</a> <a href="/episodes/I/ep1.25.html">terrible</a>.</p>      <p>You can't hear it, but The Javacrucian Order is playing Lux Aeterna for         Arthur C. Clarke, now beyond the infinite.</p>
