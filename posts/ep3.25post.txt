      <p>After an extensive delay, here's the new comic, with every frame looking 
        beautiful for once instead of just one. Perhaps that's why they're taking 
        so long.</p>
      <p>I wonder if I should e-mail <a href="http://www.grandaddylandscape.com/">Jason 
        Lytle</a> about this strip?</p>
