      <p>It took about fifty minutes just to place the word bubbles in this one 
        due to how slow my computer has become and the two shots that needed to 
        be re-edited because Simon's bubble was blocking the plant. But beyond 
        that, hooray for a new location. The town map will be updated when it's 
        not 1am and I have work in the morning. :P</p>
