      <p>Strips 14 and 15 have taken the most work so far, mainly due to all the 
        characters present. I love the first frame here though. There's so much 
        going on. Also, because it was asked, Simon is wearing an <a href="http://www.isistheband.com/Home.aspx">Isis</a> 
        shirt, not a Cthulhu shirt.</p>
