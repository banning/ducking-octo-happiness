            <td colspan="2"><p>RedBrickRoadStudios's current main project is the 
                webcomic <em>Walden</em> about a group of friends living in the 
                present Henry David Thoreau warned us against, one in which all 
                the land is owned and a man may not even walk in the woods that 
                he loves. Faced with a reality populated by the seemingly paranormal 
                that can easily be explained away by physicalist models, the cast 
                confronts the unknowable mystery of life with naivet&eacute;, 
                confusion, and arrogance.</p>
              <p>The main story is told episodically on Monday, Wednesday, and 
                Friday. Short <a href="strips/strip_archive.html">gag strips</a> 
                are sometime posted on Sundays. They're not vital to the main 
                story arcs, however. A brief rundown of the characters can be 
                found below.</p>
              <p>Our work can also be seen on the fan section of the <a href="http://www.brokensaints.com/">Broken 
                Saints DVD</a> in the form of a stop motion Legos movie and its 
                accompanying mock-u-mentary.</p>

              maintains a generally upbeat attitude despite the pitfalls he faces 
              in his day to day journey through college life, possibly guided 
              by his belief in a logical, well-ordered Universe. He feels any 
              problem can be solved by a rational, well thought-out examination 
              followed by communicating what is learned to all parties involved.

                tends to view the world rather cynically. This outlook may derive 
                from associating with other jaded artists or simply be the result 
                of watching too many 24-hour news channels. Thanks to a student 
                work program, he currently draws for the police. He can always
