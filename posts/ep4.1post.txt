      <p>Due to massive fan protest at the death of nearly all the cast, the story 
        will be restarting immediately after the <a href="episode.php?epsiode=2&part=0">Baseball 
        Episode</a>, three years prior to the Camping Episode.</p>
      <p>I am extremely happy with how the first frame of this strip came out. 
        I plan on varying the camera angle more and this experiment took little 
        time to draw and works exactly how I wanted it to. After all those attempts 
        at drawing the characters from behind in the previous episode, I finally 
        broke out of the habit of side views. Then in frame two I fall back into 
        it.</p>
      <p>In other news, the site is finally running on version 2.0, which took 
        longer than the <a href="episode.php?epsiode=3&part=16">&quot;less than a month&quot;</a> 
        I originally promised. The major change is the site is now being controlled 
        by templates and an expanded cascading style sheet, so when I add a new 
        part to an episode, I just have to update one page to change the links 
        on every part of that chapter as opposed to the blunt idiocy I was previously 
        using to update all those pages. I'm also testing the waters with advertising 
        with a banner for my hosting service at the bottom. Expect Google ads 
        soon, and please don't be scared away by them. Money helps make the comic 
        better. All pages will soon have unique tags too to increase the number 
        of spiders crawling the pages (which currently account for half my audience.)</p>
      <p>But these are stupid structural changes, John, you might say. Well there 
        have also been updates to page art as well as better descriptions on the 
        <a href="about.html">about</a> and <a href="episodes/ep_archive.html">episode 
        archive</a> pages. So not only can the site be updated a lot more quickly, 
        it also has a better presentation. But all that really matters is that 
        I keep these strips coming on time.</p>
