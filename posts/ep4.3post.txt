      <p>This one's for all you Robert Browning and Neon Genesis fans.</p>
      <p>I'm not too sure if the first frame is a good portrayal of action, but 
        I'm very pleased with the camera in the second shot.</p>
      <p>Romney suspended his campaign yesterday, making my <a href="episode.php?episode=4&part=2">previous 
        post</a> irrelevant. Thanks a lot.</p>
