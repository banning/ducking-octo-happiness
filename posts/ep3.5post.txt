      <p>Wow, it took a whole week to complete the other half of this joke. Things 
        are still a bit unstable, so the next update probably won't be until Thanksgiving 
        or Buy Nothing Day. I'm very excited about this episode though. There's 
        a lot of fun stuff coming up, and there are some more rants planned. For 
        the moment though, here's the next installment, as promised.</p>
