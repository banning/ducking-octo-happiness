      <p>I promised fewer late updates and now today's goes up in the evening. 
        I'm a monster. In compensation, I give you the longest strip yet (six 
        frames!) and the most disturbing strip yet (uh oh...). Satyrs are known 
        for their lascivious behavior though, so things aren't that out of hand.</p>
      <p>In regards to rants, I have ideas planned out, I just need to find the 
        time and stamina to write them. But you're here for the comic and not 
        some pointless babbling, right?</p>
