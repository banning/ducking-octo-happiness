<p>On August 15, <a href="http://www.wnep.com/Global/story.asp?S=7000840">a 
              blob of light started appearing on a garage door in Minersville, 
              PA</a> that many claim looks like the Virgin Mary. While ninety 
              years after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Fatima">Our 
              Lady of Fatima</a>, that incident at least had prophecies and culminated 
              in the sun dancing around the sky. This is an ambiguous blob that 
              may or may not be a reflection of sunlight, which people in a heavily 
              Catholic neighborhood just happen to believe looks like the Virgin 
              Mary. Perhaps an appearance in the Protestant south would have turned 
              the shape into Jesus himself. (Tibetans might have construed it 
              as the Buddha, but the Chinese government is slowly working to outlaw 
              that.) If it is just a reflection of the sun, perhaps looking directly 
              at that star would reveal further holy faces. It just so happens 
              individuals with a more scientific background happen to be seeing 
              either a <a href="http://physorg.com/news109430733.html">giant trilobite 
              or a giant dividing cell</a> swimming through the plasma. So while 
              the Virgin is manifesting before the faithful in Minersville, Pennsylvania, 
              the Great Old Ones are rearing their alien heads in the sun. Although 
              if people are going to project their cultural beliefs onto meaningless 
              natural phenomenon, at least they're beliefs promoting peace and 
              well being. Apophenia is what gives life meaning.</p>
