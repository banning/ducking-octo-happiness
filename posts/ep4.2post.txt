      <p>I had so much fun making frame four.</p>
      <p>So Mike Huckabee kicked ass yesterday winning five states. Sure, he's 
        only successful in the south, but as a Discordian, I enjoy constructive 
        chaos, and anything that delays the Republican quantum wave from collapsing 
        on a nominee is beautiful. It would be very interesting if no one got 
        a majority of delegates and the Republican nominee wasn't selected until 
        the convention in September while the Democratic candidate spent all summer 
        campaigning. Of course, having the pulpit to oneself didn't help Rudy 
        &quot;I leapt in front of an airplane on September 11 to save New York&quot; 
        Giuliani in Florida.</p>
