        <tr> 
          <td><p><font color="#000000">____</font> In regards to creating the 
              psychology of the Joker for The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan has 
              stated that the thing he is most afraid of is &quot;<a href="http://movies.ign.com/articles/839/839933p2.html">chaos 
              and anarchy</a>.&quot; The Joker is widely regarded as Batman's 
              greatest nemesis, for he is both the complete opposite of what Batman 
              symbolizes and the risk of what Bruce Wayne can always become. Whereas 
              Wayne's response to a lawless world was to turn to vigilante justice 
              in an attempt to restore order, the man who would become the Joker 
              lost his sanity and became the epitome of a world he could not handle, 
              at least as he is portrayed in Alan Moore's The Killing Joke. In 
              response to &quot;one bad day,&quot; Batman was born in order to 
              symbolize order while the Joker came to symbolize chaos.</p>
            <p><font color="#000000">____</font> At the end of The Killing Joke, 
              Batman offers to help the Joker get therapy and the Joker refuses, 
              telling instead the story of two men in an asylum who escape to 
              the roof. One jumps across the gap between the asylum and the next 
              building and makes it to freedom while the second is too afraid. 
              The first offers to shine his flashlight across the gap so the second 
              can walk across the beam to which the latter responds, &quot;No, 
              no. What do you think I am, crazy? You'd turn the light off when 
              I was halfway across.&quot; The two men are of course Batman and 
              the Joker and the asylum is society. Bruce Wayne is able to succesfully 
              escape the madness of the world by jumping across the abyss and 
              seeking order in a meaningless universe while the Joker cannot face 
              the blackness and instead goes insane. This is the path Bruce Wayne 
              can always fall onto, thus the Joker represents the ultimate descent 
              of Batman should he ever take justice to the point of killing.</p>
            <p><font color="#000000">____</font> As a clown, the Joker is the 
              trickster archetype. In certain Amerindian tribes, individuals portraying 
              this form had free reign to disrupt ceremonies and behave in any 
              manner they wished, even being known to ride backwards into battle. 
              A trickster could walk into the most sacred ritual and belch for 
              he was a reminder that everything was a creation of the human mind 
              and had no absolute significance in the grand scheme of the cosmos. 
              It is the apparent law and order that our society holds dear which 
              the Joker finds so hilarious. In the teaser trailer for Nolan's 
              The Dark Knight, the Joker states, &quot;Starting tonight, people 
              will die. I'm a man of my word,&quot; and then bursts into a cackle. 
              It is the cliche statement &quot;I'm a man of my word,&quot; that 
              brings him to fits; the idea that there is any purpose or reason 
              to this world is absurd and is the greatest joke of all.</p>
            <p><font color="#000000">____</font> Of course, the Joker has been 
              portrayed in various ways in DC comics, from a harmless prankster 
              during the comic code years to a sane criminal hiding behind the 
              mask of madness to the serious psychopath in his original incarnation 
              and the latest representations. It is the latter version that I 
              feel resounds the most meaningfully, allowing Batman and the Joker 
              to transcend a mere hero and villain and become archetypes representing 
              greater ideas in the human experience.</p></td>
