      <p>Thus concludes the Torgo trilogy. The plot will be moving on from here.</p>
      <p>This strip is a lot more straightforward than part 7. That one was kind 
        of rushed, resulting in the weird character placement in regards to who 
        is talking to whom and the book which disappears and then reappears in 
        Simon's hand. Sorry for that. It will be fixed eventually.</p>
