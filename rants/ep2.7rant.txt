<p>Simon might also be pointing 
              out where his <a href="http://www.crazyhorse.org/">dead lay buried</a>. 
              Once completed, Crazy Horse will be so large that his head alone 
              will be the size of all of Mount Rushmore, which is just east of 
              the memorial. That series of busts was designed by Gutzon Borglum, 
              who originally intended to have a plaque in the shape of the Lousiana 
              purchase where Licoln's bust is as Jefferson was to be to Washington's 
              right. The plaque would have contained an explanation of the monument's 
              purpose, but the geology of the mountain led to the workers running 
              out of space and thus abandoning the original design. Hopefully 
              the information contained within the visitor's center will survive 
              the coming millennia, or Wyoming will be home to the future's equivalents 
              of the Great Sphinx or the Easter Island Heads. Four eroded heads 
              will gaze over the land but be dwarfed by the mountain in the shape 
              of a man riding a horse and pointing to the ancestoral lands of 
              the Lakota indians. The controversy surrounding land ownership and 
              four caucasians carved into a sacred Lakota mountain won't matter 
              by then if the history of past civilizations is taken into consideration. 
              Ideally, our society will remain prosperous long enough for their 
              construction to never be forgotten by human beings and the giants 
              of Wyoming won't become debated by archeologists four thousand years 
              from now. Still, it's strange to consider explorers emerging from 
              the forest to behold the giant worn and crumbling men, wondering 
              about their purpose. By then, the conflicting cultural beliefs which 
              carved (or are in the process of carving) both monuments may no 
              longer be relevant, just as the memes which forged the pyramids 
              and the Sphinx no longer guide any civilization. We sculp nephilim 
              of rock so that future generations will remember what we believed 
              and what we lived for. In my mind I recall a recording of Vincent 
              Price reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias">Ozymandias</a>.</p>
