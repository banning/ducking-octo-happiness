        <tr> 
          <td><p>(This ended up going in a completely different direction than 
              what I had originally written last night while tired and in need 
              of sleep. I think it came out a lot better. Late updates just mean 
              better quality.) </p>
            <p><font color="#000000">____</font> On September 16, a trail cam 
              set up in the Allegheny National Forest in western Pennsylvania 
              snapped a picture of two bear cubs investigating the mineral block 
              that had been set out to attract deer. Twenty-eight minutes later, 
              <a href="http://www.bfro.net/avevid/jacobs/jacobs_photos.asp">this</a> 
              was photographed twice. The Pennsylvania Game Commission insists 
              it&#8217;s just a mangy bear while the <a href="http://www.bradfordera.com/articles/2007/10/30/news/doc472157e354331297648198.txt">Bradford 
              Era</a> newspaper isn&#8217;t so sure, and others leap right to 
              the label of sasquatch.</p>
            <p><font color="#000000">____</font> The BFRO has a nice conspiracy 
              theory about the Pennsylvania Game Commission and the <a href="http://www.bradfordera.com/articles/2007/10/30/news/doc4722b121b961b265436842.txt">photo</a> 
              the PGC provided of a mange stricken bear doesn&#8217;t really help 
              their argument for the creature being a common bruin, so maybe they 
              are trying to deny the obvious. Then again, the picture offered 
              up by cryptozoologist Loren Coleman does seem to argue in favor 
              of a <a href="http://www.cryptomundo.com/cryptozoo-news/jacobs-cryptid/">skinny 
              bear</a> as opposed to an unknown species. Maybe if the animal was 
              standing upright there&#8217;d be a better case for a sasquatch. 
              Sarcoptic mange seems to be a common cause of cryptid sightings 
              in recent years though, particularly in the <a href="http://www.cryptomundo.com/cryptozoo-news/cuero-chupa/">chupacabras</a> 
              that keep getting killed in Texas. Disappointingly, they always 
              turn out to be mangy coyotes.</p>
            <p><font color="#000000">____</font> While no mystery is best left 
              unsolved, the identity of the Jacobs creature is probably going 
              to remain unverifiable unless someone finds a mangy bear in the 
              area very soon. At least we have the story revolving around it though, 
              and in the absence of a new species of large mammal roaming Pennsylvania, 
              we have the apophenia a strange photo has generated. Everything 
              we do in life involves storytelling, and it takes bizarre incidents 
              like this to make that apparent. There are people who &#8220;know&#8221; 
              the animal is just a bear and there are those who &#8220;know&#8221; 
              it is a sasquatch, and there are those who are not so sure they 
              know what it is. While agnosticism seems to be prevailing in a lot 
              of people surroundings these photographs, it doesn&#8217;t so much 
              in less strange matters. I feel it should. We perceive the world 
              through our expectations, and usually only remember the things which 
              match our conception of how things &#8220;are.&#8221; When people 
              repeat what others have said, they tend to misquote, only repeating 
              the same general idea and not the exact phrasing. But they also 
              have tendencies to alter even the root meaning, speaking what they 
              thought was meant.</p>
            <p> <font color="#000000">____</font> Everything we experience is 
              essentially a photograph of a blurry animal. All we can do is interpret 
              it through our filters and reality tunnels, only we don&#8217;t 
              realize such and believe our perceptions of things to be the things 
              in and of themselves. The sole reason for the lack of understanding 
              in this world is the failure to realize that our ideas are not absolutes. 
              Other people seem a lot less crazy when you understand that all 
              of life is a fiction, and it is the molding of this fiction that 
              gives our lives meaning. It is only when confronting the outr&eacute; 
              that this attribute of the human mind becomes apparent, whether 
              it&#8217;s when a sick coyote turns into the blood sucking, escaped 
              alien pet which terrorizes the southwest, or a blob of light becomes 
              the <a href="ep2.6rant.html">Virgin Mary</a>. </p>
            <p><font color="#000000">____</font> The Jacobs creature is the symbol 
              of all our attempts at understanding reality and each other: at 
              best, vague and confusing, at worst, &#8220;causing more concern 
              and panic than is necessary,&#8221; to use the words of the Pennsylvania 
              Game Commission. Maybe someone just needs to cartoon the beast up 
              and slap him on a t-shirt like they did with the chupacabras, and 
              he won&#8217;t be so scary anymore. ;) </p></td>
