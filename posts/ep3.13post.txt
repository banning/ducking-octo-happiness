      <p>Here is the first complicated, time consuming part of this episode. This 
        took me over twelve hours to make because I don't have a drawing pad, 
        so I'm tracing with a mouse. That situation should be rectified in the 
        near term, but for now I'll keep doing it the stupid way.</p>
      <p>Simon is wearing a band shirt. That's all I'm going to say, but if you've 
        read certain esoterica, you should be able to figure out what it's referencing. 
        I'm not explaining everything around here. It's more fun to solve puzzles 
        than to be told the solution.</p>
