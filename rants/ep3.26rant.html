              <a href="http://www.stopaptrail.org/">Grassroot groups</a> and <a href="http://casey.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=278382">Senator 
              Bob Casey</a> are working to halt the construction of electrical 
              transmission towers through Pennsylvania to locations in New Jersey 
              and West Virginia that can't maintain their own power plants. Pennsylvania 
              residents feel the towers are eyesores, however. There&#8217;s also 
              the potential (but not verified) risk of increased childhood leukemia 
              rates among people growing up near such constructions.</p>
            <p><font color="#000000">____</font> Pennsylvania is also on the front 
              lines of wind power as the United States seriously begins considering 
              moving towards a &#8220;green&#8221; economy. Two turbine farms 
              (They&#8217;re not wind mills. The blades aren&#8217;t attached 
              to a mill of any kind; they&#8217;re attached to a generator. They&#8217;re 
              not milling any grain; they&#8217;re producing electricity. Learn 
              the meaning of words before using them) already exist in Pennsylvania, 
              and Not In My Back Yard groups are rallying to stop any more. Again, 
              the eyesore claim is mentioned, although like the leukemia engendered 
              by transmission towers, wind farms have their own real world problems: 
              namely two of the largest bat kills ever found in the state from 
              the blades striking the animals. Also like the leukemia though, 
              whether or not the farms will have an impact on bat populations 
              is still under study.</p>
            <p><font color="#000000">____</font> While there are other very good 
              reasons to oppose such constructions and I'm not advocating for 
              them, the eyesore claim is a bit subjective, and the mutable perception 
              of reality is the topic on which these rants seem to focus. <a href="http://fusionanomaly.net/electricaltransmissiontowers.html">This 
              person</a> discusses how he enjoys the sight of transmission towers. 
              Rather than being a blot on nature&#8217;s pristine landscape (Virgin 
              wilderness? There&#8217;s nothing virgin about flowering trees and 
              rutting deer), he sees them as the result of nature becoming self-conscious. 
              Man is neither above the animals nor outside of the natural world. 
              2.4 billion years ago, anaerobic cells poisoned themselves with 
              the oxygen they produced as a waste gas and caused an ecological 
              crisis; fermentation without the aid of distillation can only produce 
              beverages of about 24 proof with a maximum of 30 because the yeast 
              kill themselves on their waste: ethanol. While our own release of 
              toxins into the environment is certainly harmful, it shouldn&#8217;t 
              be viewed as something unnatural. Those transmission towers and 
              turbines are a part of nature, are the product of nature becoming 
              intelligent. They are termite mounds on another level.<br>
              <br>
              <font color="#000000">____</font> View them as the products of an 
              alien intelligence. There&#8217;s a wonder in observing these structures 
              towering over the forest and cutting through the hills. It&#8217;s 
              like watching structures rising in Sim City or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0734655/">The 
              Little People</a> episode of the Twilight Zone (or its parodies 
              on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_VII#The_Genesis_Tub">Simpsons</a> 
              and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfellas">Futurama</a>). 
              Such little, seemingly insignificant creatures can raise these works 
              out of the minerals of the soil and use them to enhance their own 
              existence. The fUSION Anomaly's author views the rows of transmission 
              towers running through forests and deserts as physical manifestations 
              of the no&ouml;sphere, representations of our information age. The 
              generation and delivery of electricity is one of the foundations 
              of contemporary civilization. The United States is even embroiled 
              in a guerilla war because of such reliance. Now the towers are seeming 
              kind of ominous, but that&#8217;s due to wasteful practices and 
              foolish behavior and not anything inherent in energy consumption.<br>
              <br>
              <font color="#000000">____</font> Such structures needn&#8217;t 
              be considered eyesores. They are simply another aspect of the affront 
              to entropy that is life, providing the flow of resources that keeps 
              a species thriving, not unlike the mycorrhizae networking the trees 
              in the soil beneath.<br>
              <br>
              <font color="#000000">____</font> Then again, there is all that 
              leukemia and all those dead bats. What&#8217;s going to be thriving 
              on our toxins once we kill ourselves off and no human ever again 
              breathes the oxygenated air while sipping a can of beer?</p></td>
