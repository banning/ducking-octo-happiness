      <p>Here's the comic, late as usual. The second frame originally had everyone 
        facing the camera and looking sullenly at the dirt, but it seemed like 
        Torgo's body was out of view on the ground, which it isn't supposed to 
        be, so I cut Guy and Emily out and drew their backs to create the circle.</p>
