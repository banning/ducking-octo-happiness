      <p>Damn am I tired. I consulted with Mike recently on improving the artwork 
        for the characters and was advised to be more cartoony with the hands 
        as opposed to the realistic ones I was drawing. After taking that into 
        consideration and studying Leela's hands on an episode of Futurama, I 
        drew Fro's in a shorter amount of time than usual and think I did a pretty 
        good job. There would have been more hand action in the last frame, but 
        no matter how short the strip is, I seem to always end up finishing these 
        long after midnight.</p>
      <p>We have a new wrinkle scheme as well now since I looked at real world 
        wrinkles instead of just guessing where they would fall on clothing like 
        I had been doing. I think the results are much better.</p>
      <p>Finally, this episode was written long before those &quot;Messing with 
        Sasquatch&quot; commercials. Let that be a lesson, kids. Make your ideas 
        as soon as you get them or someone else will come up with them as well 
        and then you'll just look unoriginal.</p>
