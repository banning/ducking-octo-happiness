            <p><font color="#000000">____</font> This article needs numerous citations 
              to what it's referencing, but I'm making excuses because I need 
              to get travelling and it's potentially going to snow. I've tried 
              to link to as much as possible despite the rush. Someday I'll be 
              able to put enough time into these to give you something of substance. 
              If anything is exaggerated or just plain wrong here, well that's 
              why it's called a rant. Don't believe things just because you read 
              them online. </p>
            <p><font color="#000000">____</font> The spread of information technology 
              is usually cited as one of the primary causes of the collapse of 
              the Soviet Union. When the people saw how the rest of the world 
              was living, they grew dissatisfied with their government. Transhumanists 
              continue to espouse the praises of information technology as making 
              government more open and revealing corruption, allowing our societies 
              to become freer. So why then can the president declare any American 
              citizen an <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/commissions.html">enemy 
              combatant, strip them of constitutional rights, and send them indefinitely 
              to a European prison without telling anyone, not even the accused, 
              of the crime committed?</a> Or why has Congress passed a law violating 
              the Constitution by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/washington/06nsa.html?hp">legalizing 
              warrantless wiretapping</a> of American citizens? The nations of 
              the Eastern Bloc conducted these same practices. The difference 
              now is, we&#8217;re aware of it. We know which rooms in which telecommunication 
              buildings the NSA has installed <a href="http://www.spamdailynews.com/publish/ATT_tech_outs_NSA_spy_room.asp">espionage 
              technology</a>. We know that the United States government is torturing 
              prisoners, where it is torturing them, and what techniques are being 
              used. Hell, we know that, prior to taking power, the Vice President, 
              the former Secretary of Defense, and the former President of the 
              World Bank Group, among others, signed a <a href="http://www.newamericancentury.org/">document</a> 
              calling for a military presence in Iraq and a retainment of it there 
              to protect American interests, and now people are shocked that the 
              Bush administration is planning on remaining in Iraq <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/004772.php">indefinitely</a>. 
              What do they think all the <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views07/0319-26.htm">bases</a> 
              we're constructing are for?</p>
            <p><font color="#000000">____</font> Information technology is supposed 
              to suppress tyranny by making society more open and people more 
              accountable for their actions. Instead, all it&#8217;s doing is 
              allowing us to watch exactly how the hegemons are seizing power. 
              Technology can only act as a tool if we use it, and most people 
              really don&#8217;t seem to care, or even prefer how things are progressing. 
              The Soviet Union collapsed because people were able to see that 
              capitalist nations were richer and the people there could afford 
              luxury items. The Russians wanted that too. Now the Russian economy 
              is stable and the people are wealthy. They see Putin as the source 
              of this, and rather than being disgusted by his increasing stranglehold 
              on Russian politics, they want him to <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2786588.ece">stay 
              in power</a>. In the United States, as long as you still have your 
              Sport Utility Vehicle, air conditioning, large house, and iPod to 
              shut out the rest of the world, then who cares about civil liberties? 
              They can have them so long as we keep getting the big paychecks. 
              It&#8217;s not freedom people want; it&#8217;s luxury and stability.</p>
